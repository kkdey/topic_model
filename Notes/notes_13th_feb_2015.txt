Today I am putting the first update (R codes, .html files and figures) into Github...I wish to keep track of this using 

a notes folder which will be updated each time I push something big into this repo.

Today's important notes:

In Figs folder, I have present all the important figures of test runs of different models. But right now, the figures in 

the Poisson Reads Model 2 are not adjusted for the overdispersion, so they need to be modified. 

Also, we need to put some tests.R files to test the significance of the outputs obtained from running the R codes
